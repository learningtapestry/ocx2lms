        In the novel Things Fall Apart, Pulitzer Prize-winner Chinua Achebe
        crafts the story of his central character, Okonkwo, an Igbo tribesman
        that lives during the European colonization of Africa. Through analyzing
        Achebe’s text, we will explore the following question: What does it mean
        for things to fall apart? We will examine the internal and external
        factors that influence and define who we become and how we make choices
        in our lives through the lens of the characters in Achebe’s novel. Our
        work will culminate with an expository essay that analyzes these forces
        in Okonkwo’s life.

        Culminating Task Prompt: Write a character analysis of Okonkwo. In your
        analysis, consider how internal and external factors influence his
        relationships and contribute to his fate at the end of the novel. In
        your response, be sure to do the following:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Include a clearly stated thesis that conveys your stance.</li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>Summarize Okonkwo’s story, experiences, and motivations.</li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Develop your thesis through a sequence of claims related to internal
          factors (e.g., beliefs, fears, traits) and external factors (e.g.,
          plot events and developments, setting).
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>Use specific examples from the text.</li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Clearly communicate your analysis through effective word choices,
          sentence and paragraph development, and transitions among ideas.
        </li>

      <ol>
