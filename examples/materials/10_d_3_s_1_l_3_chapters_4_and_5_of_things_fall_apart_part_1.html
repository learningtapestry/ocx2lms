      <p>Chapter 4:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          “But he was struck, as most people were, by Okonkwo’s brusqueness in
          dealing with less successful men” (p. 28). Define brusqueness. Why do
          you think Okonkwo behaves like this?
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
          What does the Western proverb “We make our own luck” mean? How is it
          similar to the way chi is discussed in the novel?
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Describe the relationship Ikemefuna has with Okonkwo and Nwoye. What
          evidence from the text supports your interpretation?
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
          What inferences can you make about Okonkwo’s character based on his
          actions during the Week of Peace and his punishment afterward?
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Chapter 5:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          This chapter begins with two additional stories of Okonkwo losing his
          temper. What happens? What do you think the author’s purpose in
          providing these stories? What might these stories foreshadow?
