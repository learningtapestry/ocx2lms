      <p>Chapter 2:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Consider the following quote: "A snake was never called by its name at
          night, because it would hear" (p. 13). What are superstitions? Do you
          or your family members have any superstitions? How are they similar to
          those of Umuofia? How are they different?
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
          What do you learn about Umuofia from the marketplace meeting about the
          death of Ezeugo?
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Describe Okonkwo's relationships with his wives and children and
          explain the reason for his behavior. What evidence from the text
          offers the strongest support for his interpretation?
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Chapter 3:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Why does Nwakibie trust Okonkwo enough to offer him yam seeds?</li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
          What is share-cropping? Why is it a "very slow way of building up a
          barn of one's own" (p. 25)?
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Describe Okonkwo's first harvest. How do you think the harvest
          affected him? What evidence from the text offers the strongest support
          for this interpretation?
        </li>
      </ol>
