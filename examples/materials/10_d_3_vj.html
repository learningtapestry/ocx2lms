        Throughout the unit, document words or concepts that you do not know or
        that you think are important to learn and practice. You might use
        context clues from the text you are reading to assist in determining
        what the words mean. You might also consult a dictionary or other
        reference material. Many words or concepts have more than one meaning,
        so be sure to think about the context in which they are used to
        determine the most accurate meaning. Some words may be provided by your
        teacher, but you should also note any other words you find interesting.
