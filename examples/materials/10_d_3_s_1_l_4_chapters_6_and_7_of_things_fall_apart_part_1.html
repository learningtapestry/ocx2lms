          Describe the two sides of Chielo. What type of professions are similar
          to Chielo’s in today’s world? Explain.

        <li>
          Why does Nwoye prefer the stories of his mother, but pretend to prefer
          the stories of his father? What do you think this preference could
          foreshadow in the novel?

          In the Bible, locusts are one of the ten plagues that descend on
          Egypt: “They covered the face of the whole land, so that the land was
          darkened, and they ate all the plants in the land and all the fruit of
          the trees that the hail had left. Not a green thing remained, neither
          tree nor plant of the field, through all the land of Egypt” (Exodus
          10:15). How does this compare to how locusts are described in Things
          Fall Apart? How do you explain the difference?

          “‘Yes, Umuofia has decided to kill him’” (p. 56). How does the use of
          the village name “Umuofia” impact the meaning of this sentence? What
          other words or names could he have used instead? How would that have
          changed the meaning of the sentence?
        </li>
        <li>
          After finishing this chapter, what are your thoughts on the village
          elders from Umuofia? Okonkwo?
