          >This unit, like all units in the Odell Education High School Literacy
          Program, employs a suite of tools and resources from the Odell
          Education Literacy Toolbox as well as tools specific to the unit’s
          content and instructional sequences. Students can be supported
          throughout the unit by using materials from the Literacy Toolbox,
          beyond those that are referenced in the unit. Tools are graphic
          organizers that support students’ reading and writing by helping them
          think through text, find pertinent textual details, and develop ideas
          for their writing. Note that many, such as the</span

          scaffolds, they can be assigned at your discretion, or students might
