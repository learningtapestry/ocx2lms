        <span style="font-size: 1.09em"
          >When having students define words using contextual clues, keep in
          mind that the complexity of the context clues might vary greatly
          depending on the student’s linguistic and cultural background. These
          differences are grounded in students’ understanding not only of
          language, but of content as well. For example, native English speakers
          might grasp nuances in contextual clues, such as tone or cultural
          references, while English learners might not understand, making it all
          the more difficult for them to define the targeted vocabulary
          word.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-size: 1.09em"
          >You might have students draw a picture next to applicable vocabulary
          and definitions. Mental images and associations can help strengthen
          students’ understanding of newly acquired vocabulary. The picture does
          not necessarily need to be a precise depiction; rather, the mental
          image should serve as an association between the meaning of the word
          and students’ personal knowledge. For example, for the word
          contingent, a student may draw an award received for an accomplishment
          that was contingent on practice and preparation. If students are
          struggling with envisioning an image for a word, you might have them
          conduct an image search for the word online and then select an image
          related to the word’s meaning that resonates with them. Visual
          supports for key vocabulary are especially beneficial for English
          learners.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-size: 1.09em"
          >Additionally, if a word under study is a cognate—a word that shares
          similar spelling, meaning, and pronunciation with a word in another
          language—in the student’s home language, you might make connections
          between the cognate and the new vocabulary word. A cognate provides a
          bridge to the English language for English learners.</span
