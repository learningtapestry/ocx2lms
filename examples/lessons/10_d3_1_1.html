        The <strong>Unit Text List</strong> is a student-facing version of the
        <strong>Text Overview</strong> document, which is located on the unit’s
        landing page. The <strong>Text Overview</strong> contains qualitative
        analyses, and the <strong>Unit Text List</strong> does not.

      <p>
        An independent reading program might be a part of your classroom,
        school, or district practice. The Independent Reading Text Options
        provides a list of texts that are linked thematically, topically, or by
        genre to the unit. You and your students might select independent
        reading texts from the options provided to build additional knowledge on
        the topics or texts in the unit. If you have a media specialist or
        librarian, you can share this list with them to see what resources are
        available and to generate an extended list of related resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that students are frequently directed to take notes in a “Learning
        Log.” A Learning Log does not refer to a specific tool or material;
        students can use any note-taking method, such as a notebook, binder, or
        other electronic tool. This may stem from personal preference or from
        teacher or school guidance or policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are using this unit in a remote- or virtual-learning context, you
        might consult two resources: the general
        <strong>Odell Education Remote Learning Guide</strong> and the
        unit-specific <strong>Things Fall Apart Remote Learning Guide</strong>.
        The <strong>Odell Education Remote Learning Guide</strong> provides
        general guidance for strategies and structures that can be used for
        synchronous and asynchronous learning, flipped classrooms, and blended
        learning. The
        <strong>Things Fall Apart Remote Learning Guide</strong> provides remote
        learning suggestions for each lesson.

        Chinua Achebe’s (1930-2013) masterful trilogy begins with
        <em>Things Fall Apart</em>,a novel set in pre-colonial Nigeria and often
        called “The Great African novel.” Born in an Igbo village in Nigeria,
        Achebe grew up in colonized Nigeria, where he was influenced by both
        Christian and Igbo beliefs. <em>Things Fall Apart</em> is followed by
        two additional novels, <em>No Longer at Ease</em> and
        <em>Arrow of God,</em> which follow the story<em>.</em> Achebe’s awards
        include the Man Booker International Prize for fiction and the Dorothy
        and Lillian Gish Prize.

      <p>
        Chinua Achebe’s (1930-2013) masterful trilogy begins with
        <em>Things Fall Apart</em>,a novel set in pre-colonial Nigeria and often
        called “The Great African novel.” Born in an Igbo village in Nigeria,
        Achebe grew up in colonized Nigeria, where he was influenced by both
        Christian and Igbo beliefs. <em>Things Fall Apart</em> is followed by
        two additional novels, <em>No Longer at Ease</em> and
        <em>Arrow of God,</em> which follow the story<em>.</em> Achebe’s awards
        include the Man Booker International Prize for fiction and the Dorothy
        and Lillian Gish Prize.
